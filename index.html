                    <h2 class="header">My Young Years</h2>
                    <p>Although I was not at the level of Sheldon from '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>', I showed an interest in programming, science, and engineering since I was very young. When I was little I would collect old keys and test them on different locks around the house every day. I knew they would not work but I liked seeing what keys would fit into what keyholes. As I grew up my family got me tools for my birthdays and Christmas. I got old hand drills, screwdrivers, drill bits, little kits with different size bolts, and screws. I loved my tools and I started taking old things apart to see how they worked. I never understood anything I saw inside but it still fascinated me. I kept boxes under my bed that were filled with parts from things I disassembled.

                    <h2 class="header">I Get Older</h2>
                    <p>When I was older I got more into programming. I discovered Arduino and raspberry pi's and I did my research and determined that I needed an RPI. Looking back I was young and did not make the right decision. Older me would have gotten younger me an Arduino to start with. I remember the table I sat at as I set up the RPI. I was so happy. When I got it working the first thing I discovered is that it can't be powered back on after shutdown. You have to unplug it and plug it back in. So, I fixed that. I used a button to short GND and 5V so it would boot back up (not a great idea :/ but I was young).
