                    <h2 class="header">My Young Years</h2>
                    <p>Although I was not at the level of Sheldon from '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>', I showed an interest in programming, science, and engineering since I was very young. When I was little I would collect old keys and test them on different locks around the house every day. I knew they would not work but I liked seeing what keys would fit into what keyholes. As I grew up my family got me tools for my birthdays and Christmas. I got old hand drills, screwdrivers, drill bits, little kits with different size bolts, and screws. I loved my tools and I started taking old things apart to see how they worked. I never understood anything I saw inside but it still fascinated me. I kept boxes under my bed that were filled with parts from things I disassembled.

                    <h2 class="header">I Get Older</h2>
                    <p>When I was older I got more into programming. I discovered Arduino and raspberry pi's and I did my research and determined that I needed an RPI. Looking back I was young and did not make the right decision. Older me would have gotten younger me an Arduino to start with. I remember the table I sat at as I set up the RPI. I was so happy. When I got it working the first thing I discovered is that it can't be powered back on after shutdown. You have to unplug it and plug it back in. So, I fixed that. I used a button to short GND and 5V so it would boot back up (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=153785">not a great idea</a> :/ but I was young).

                    <h2 class="header">Middle School</h2>
                    <p>Throughout middle school I got an Arduino, I got more Arduinos, and I got more RPI's. I learned how to host websites on my RPI's using the LAMP server configuration. I wanted to have user accounts on my website so I did a lot of copy/pasting from tutorials and as I worked with the PHP and spliced together bits of code from different places, I started to understand how it worked and I began programming it myself. I also messed around with Arduino. I tried different things but for the most part, I worked on my "Arduino Desktop Project". It was the start of a smart home system like JARVIS. I planned to work with the arduino I had and at some point I would move to a RPI when I got the expirence I needed. I would just work on it and add new features and improve bits as I got beter and eventualy when I was older I would have an AI better than JARVIS. I stopped the project and put it on the back burner so I could work on difrent things but I still plan on working on it in the far future.</p>

                    <h2 class="header">Present Time - High School</h2>
                    <p>In high school, I did not mess around with Arduino much but my life in RPI started to take off. I learned how to use them for file servers, I one up as a VPN so I could access my other servers remotely. I also got into networking. I learned how to make a separate subnet on our router for my servers so that our other devices would be more secure. I set up the internet for my dad's rental house he bought with a buddy of his and I am tech support for them. Life was great, but then over the summer of 2020 on 07/16/2020 something amazing happened; I became a member of a project. I saw a post on social media asking for people's opinions on a project someone started. It was an ESP32 weather station kit that would connect to your account on their website and allow you to view the data from anywhere. I thought it was cool and using my background in web dev I gave them a few suggestions and fixes. They like it and I became the third member. Today we have two backend devs (me and the guy who had the idea for the project), two frontend devs, one guy for social media, and our hardware dev who designs the kits. We are all from different countries and continents so we have to work remotely but it means we have access to a wider audience. </p>
